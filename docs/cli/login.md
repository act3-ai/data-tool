Provide authentication credentials for OCI push and pull operations

## Synopsis

Provide authentication credentials for OCI push and pull operations
This will prompt for a user name and password, and will authenticate to the provided registry. If successful, the credentials will be used for future interactions with that registry by adding an entry to your ~/.docker/config.json.

This supports storing credentials in credential helpers for increased security. Furthermore, it does not support directly providing passwords, whether plaintext or through an expanded environment variable.

Example - Password from stdin:
  ace-dt login -u username --password-stdin reg.example.com

Example - Password from the environment variable $PASSWORD:
  ace-dt login -u username -p=env:PASSWORD
or the shorthand version:
  ace-dt login -u username -p=PASSWORD

Example - Password from command:
  ace-dt login -u username -p="cmd:secret-tool lookup username exampleuser server reg.example.com"

Example - Password from file:
  ace-dt login -u username -p=file:/absolute/path/pass.txt
