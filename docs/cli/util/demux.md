# ace-dt util demux

Demultiplex stdin into the files specified

## Synopsis

The data will be appended to the files given and created if they do not exist.

## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt util demux [out1 out2 ...]  [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh

Interleave file1, file2, and file3 onto the same stream and separate them back out.  The file1 and file1-dup will be identical.  Likewise for the other files.
	ace-dt util mux file1 file2 file3 | ace-dt util demux file1-dup file2-dup file3-dup

This can be combined with named pipes or unnamed pipes (requires bash to use process substitution):
	ace-dt util mux <(command to stream from A) <(command to stream from B) > f
	ace-dt util demux >(command to stream to A) >(command to stream to B) < f
		
Can be combined with the mbuffer subcommand:
	ace-dt util mux <(command to stream from A) <(command to stream from B) | ace-dt util mbuffer -n 6Gi > /dev/nst0

```

  -h, --help   help for demux
