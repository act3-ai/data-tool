# ace-dt pypi labels

Displays all the computed labels for a given python distribution filename DISTNAME

## Synopsis

The labels are computed and displayed.  If a selector is present then the the output also shows if th selector matched the labels.

Labels selectors can be used refine the set of items processed by a task.  They work exactly like Kubernetes label selectors.  Each distribution file has the following labels:
- project - normalized project name (lower case with dash)
- version.major
- version.minor
- version.patch
- type (e.g., "sdist", "bdist_wheel")
- python
- abi
- platform

Limitations:
- Version specifiers of type === are supported but no others (e.g., ==, ~= are unsupported). Support can be added if needed.
- Only some of the directives in the requirements files are processed.


## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt pypi labels DISTNAME [-l selector]... [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh
This will produce two sets of labels and the selectors match.
$ ace-dt pypi labels pyzmq-23.2.1-pp39-pypy39_pp73-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl -l 'version.major=23,version.minor<5,python=pp39' -l 'type=sdist'

```

## Options

```plaintext

  -h, --help                   help for labels
