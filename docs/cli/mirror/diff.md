# ace-dt mirror diff

List images within a mirror artifact and compare with existing images.

## Synopsis

List images stored within a specified MIRROR-ARTIFACT and optionally compare them against other images.

A MIRROR-ARTIFACT is an OCI artifact generated by commands such as "ace-dt mirror gather" or "ace-dt mirror deserialize". It consolidates multiple images or multi-architecture indexes into a single repository.

By default, this command outputs a table of original references and digests of images contained within the MIRROR-ARTIFACT. Additional behaviors include:
- Comparing the images in MIRROR-ARTIFACT against one or more EXISTING-IMAGE references to highlight differences.
- Expanding nested mirror artifacts (when the --expand flag is set) to include all referenced images in the output.

The output is sent to standard output by default but can be redirected to a file using the -o flag. This command allows users to view and analyze the content of mirror artifacts without manually pulling and inspecting their manifests.


## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt mirror diff MIRROR-ARTIFACT [EXISTING-IMAGE...] [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh
To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" to standard out:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" in table format to file output.txt:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 -o table=output.txt

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" to file output.json:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 -o json=output.json

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" in json format to standard out:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 -o json

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" in csv format to file output.csv:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 -o csv=output.csv

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" but exclude any images that exist in sync-44:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-44

To list all images in "reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45" and expand any gather indexes within the referenced artifact:
ace-dt mirror diff reg.example.com/repo/data:sync-45 --expand

```

## Options

```plaintext
Options:
      --expand           Expand any nested mirror artifacts to show all images in list. (Default behavior only shows mirror artifact reference.)
  -h, --help             help for diff
  -o, --output strings   Define how you would like the output displayed. Supported types are json, csv, and table. Adding an '=' between the type and a filename can redirect to file. Multiple values are supported. (default [table])
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
Global options:
      --config stringArray         configuration file location (setable with env "ACE_DT_CONFIG").
                                   The first configuration file present is used.  Others are ignored.
                                    (default [ace-dt-config.yaml,/root/.config/ace/dt/config.yaml,/etc/ace/dt/config.yaml])
  -r, --recursive                  recursively copy the referrers
  -v, --verbosity strings[=warn]   Logging verbosity level (also setable with environment variable ACE_DT_VERBOSITY)
                                   Aliases: error=0, warn=4, info=8, debug=12 (default [warn])
```
