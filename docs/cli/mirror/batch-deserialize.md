# ace-dt mirror batch-deserialize

A command that deserializes all of the blobs in tar files located in the SYNC-DIRECTORY to the DESTINATION.

## Synopsis

SYNC-DIRECTORY is the repository holding the tar files to be deserialized. All tar files will be deserialized to DESTINATION.
DESTINATION is a remote repository WITHOUT a tag. Tags will be automatically generated based off of the image name within the tar file name.
For example, given a file "SYNC-DIRECTORY/0-image1.tar", the blobs will be deserilaized to DESTINATION and tagged as "image1".
