# ace-dt mirror batch-serialize

Serialize multiple gather artifacts to a common folder while avoiding serializing duplicate blobs.

## Synopsis

Serialize multiple gather artifacts to a common folder while avoiding serializing duplicate blobs.
		BATCH-LIST is a CSV file of gather artifacts to serialize. It expects 2 columns: the name and the artifact location. For example:

		name, artifact
		tools, reg.example.com/dev-tools:v3.3.1
		ops, reg.example.com/ops/devops:v0.5.7
		
		Artifact names are important and for synchronization purposes should be kept consistent for each unique artifact. 
		The same artifact name can exist multiple times in a BATCH-LIST, however, only the latest instance of that particular image will be serialized. It is good practice to maintain a single image name to a single artifact reference. 
		In the above BATCH-LIST, if reg.example.com/dev-tools:v3.3.0 exists in the tracker-file, only the artifacts reg.example.com/ops/devops:v0.5.7 and reg.example.com/dev-tools:v3.3.1 will be serialized. 
		
		SYNC-DIRECTORY is the local repository in which to store the tar files.

		All artifacts in the BATCH-LIST will be serialized to the SYNC-DIRECTORY unless they exist (meaning that they have been serialized already) in the tracker-file (default: SYNC-DIRECTORY/recordKeeping.csv) that is generated by ace-dt. 


## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt mirror batch-serialize BATCH-LIST SYNC-DIRECTORY [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh
ace-dt mirror batch-serialize gather.csv sync/data
		
```

## Options

```plaintext
Options:
      --compression string        Supports zstd and gzip compression methods. (Default behavior is no compression.)
      --debug string              Puts UI into debug mode, dumping all UI events to the given path.
  -h, --help                      help for batch-serialize
      --manifest-json             Save a manifest.json file similar to the output of 'ctr images export' (fully compatible) or 'docker image save' (not fully compatible). Recommended to be used on images gathered with one platform specified.
      --no-term                   Disable terminal support for fancy printing
  -q, --quiet                     Quiet mode.  Do not output any status to standard output.  Errors are still output to standard error.
      --tracker-filename string   used to override the default tracker-file name. Tracker file exists or will be created in the SYNC-DIRECTORY/data/ directory. (default "record-keeping.csv")
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
Global options:
      --config stringArray         configuration file location (setable with env "ACE_DT_CONFIG").
                                   The first configuration file present is used.  Others are ignored.
                                    (default [ace-dt-config.yaml,/root/.config/ace/dt/config.yaml,/etc/ace/dt/config.yaml])
  -r, --recursive                  recursively copy the referrers
  -v, --verbosity strings[=warn]   Logging verbosity level (also setable with environment variable ACE_DT_VERBOSITY)
                                   Aliases: error=0, warn=4, info=8, debug=12 (default [warn])
```
