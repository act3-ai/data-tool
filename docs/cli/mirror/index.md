- [`ace-dt mirror batch-deserialize`](batch-deserialize.md) - A command that deserializes all of the blobs in tar files located in the SYNC-DIRECTORY to the DESTINATION.
- [`ace-dt mirror batch-serialize`](batch-serialize.md) - Serialize multiple gather artifacts to a common folder while avoiding serializing duplicate blobs.
- [`ace-dt mirror clone`](clone.md) - A command that copies images listed in SOURCES-FILE according to the mapper.
