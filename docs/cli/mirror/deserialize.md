# ace-dt mirror deserialize

Deserializes OCI images from SOURCE-FILE and writes them to IMAGE.

## Synopsis

SOURCE-FILE is a tar file or a tape archive to read serialized data.
IMAGE is an OCI image reference to write the data to.  It is expected to have a tag specified.

If you see a "Cannot Allocate Memory error" when using a tape as the input, you probably forgot to set the block size with "--block-size" to the value that was used to write the blocks.  In the case of a tape configured wi) use in the case of large block sizes where Cannot Allocate Memory error is present)

## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt mirror deserialize SOURCE-FILE IMAGE [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh
ace-dt mirror deserialize /dev/nst0 reg.other.com/project/proj:sync-45
```

## Options

```plaintext
Options:
      --block-size int   Size of read buffer.  If 0 then no buffer is used.
      --debug string     Puts UI into debug mode, dumping all UI events to the given path.
      --dry-run          Enable dry run mode. This will consume the tar file without sending data to a registry.
  -h, --help             help for deserialize
      --no-term          Disable terminal support for fancy printing
  -q, --quiet            Quiet mode.  Do not output any status to standard output.  Errors are still output to standard error.
      --strict           Enable strict checking mode.  This will often only work if the tar stream was generated by "ace-dt mirror serialize".
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
Global options:
      --config stringArray         configuration file location (setable with env "ACE_DT_CONFIG").
                                   The first configuration file present is used.  Others are ignored.
                                    (default [ace-dt-config.yaml,/root/.config/ace/dt/config.yaml,/etc/ace/dt/config.yaml])
  -r, --recursive                  recursively copy the referrers
  -v, --verbosity strings[=warn]   Logging verbosity level (also setable with environment variable ACE_DT_VERBOSITY)
                                   Aliases: error=0, warn=4, info=8, debug=12 (default [warn])
```
