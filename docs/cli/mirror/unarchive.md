# ace-dt mirror unarchive

Efficiently scatters images listed in a TAR-FILE according to the MAPPER

## Synopsis

Efficiently scatters images listed in a TAR-FILE according to the MAPPER
		Because this is a combination of mirror deserialize and mirror scatter, it inherits all of the flags and options defined in those commands.
TAR-FILE is the name of the TAR file to be created on the local system.

The MAPPER types currently supported are nest, first-prefix (csv format), digests (csv format) and go-template.
The format of MAPPER is MAP-TYPE=MAP-ARG

If MAP-TYPE is "nest" then scatter will nest all the images under MAP-ARG.
For example, is MAP-ARG is "reg.other.com" then a gathered image "foo.com/bar" will map to "reg.other.com/foo.com/bar".

Passing a first-prefix MAPPER requires a csv file that has formatted lines of: source,destination. 
The ace-dt mirror scatter will send the source reference to the first prefix match that it makes.
This format also allows defining the source as a digest that is present in the source repository.

Passing a digests MAP-FILE requires a csv file that has formatted lines of: digest-string, destination.
Scatter will send each digest to the locations defined in the map file provided. 

Passing a go-template MAP-FILE allows greater flexibility in how references can be pushed
to destination repositories. Hermetic text Sprig functions are currently supported which allows for matching by 
prefix, digest, media-type, regex, etc.  The following additional functions are provided:

The optional reference flag is a sync tag to assign to the artifact when it is stored in CAS. E.g., "sync-1". 


## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt mirror unarchive TAR-FILE MAPPER [flags]
```

## Examples

```sh

		To nest all the images in a tar artifact under "reg.other.com/mirror" you can use
		ace-dt mirror unarchive file.tar nest=reg.other.com/mirror

		To scatter the images in a tar artifact according to a go template named file.tmpl, you can use
		ace-dt mirror unarchive file.tar go-template=file.tmpl

```

## Options

```plaintext
Options:
      --block-size int     Size of read buffer.  If 0 then no buffer is used.
      --check              Dry run- do not actually send to destination repositories
      --debug string       Puts UI into debug mode, dumping all UI events to the given path.
  -h, --help               help for unarchive
      --no-term            Disable terminal support for fancy printing
  -q, --quiet              Quiet mode.  Do not output any status to standard output.  Errors are still output to standard error.
      --reference string   Tag the gathered image on disk with this reference, if not set, latest will be used. (default "latest")
  -l, --selector strings   Only scatter manifests tagged with annotation labels, e.g., component=core,module=test
      --strict             Enable strict checking mode.  This will often only work if the tar stream was generated by "ace-dt mirror serialize".
      --subset string      Define a subset list of images to scatter with a sources.list file
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```plaintext
Global options:
      --config stringArray         configuration file location (setable with env "ACE_DT_CONFIG").
                                   The first configuration file present is used.  Others are ignored.
                                    (default [ace-dt-config.yaml,/root/.config/ace/dt/config.yaml,/etc/ace/dt/config.yaml])
  -r, --recursive                  recursively copy the referrers
  -v, --verbosity strings[=warn]   Logging verbosity level (also setable with environment variable ACE_DT_VERBOSITY)
                                   Aliases: error=0, warn=4, info=8, debug=12 (default [warn])
```
