# ace-dt oci pushdir

Push local directory as an OCI image to a remote registry

## Synopsis

PATH is a directory that will be used as the contents of the image.

## Usage

```plaintext
ace-dt oci pushdir PATH IMAGE [flags]
```

## Options

```plaintext
Options:
  -h, --help                help for pushdir
      --legacy              use legacy (a.k.a., docker) media types instead of the newer OCI media types.  This is useful for backwards compatibility with old registries (e.g., gitlab registry).
      --platform platform   platform to use for uploading image.  The format is os/arch (e.g., linux/amd64) (default all)
      --reproducible        Makes the uploaded artifact have a consistent (reproducible) digest.  This removes timestamps.  The benefit is that this produces layers that are possibly better suited for mirroring.
```
