## ace-dt mirror batch-serialize

Serialize multiple images to a common folder while avoiding serializing duplicate blobs.

### Synopsis

Serialize multiple images to a common folder while avoiding serializing duplicate blobs.
		BATCH-LIST is a CSV file of images to serialize. It has 2 columns: name and image. For example:
		name, image
		image1, reg.example.com/image1:v3.3.0
		image2, reg.example.com/image2:v0.5.7
		
		SYNC-REPOSITORY is the local repository in which to store the tar files.

		All images in the BATCH-LIST will be serialized to the SYNC-REPOSITORY. 
		If a tracker file exists (generated by the mirror batch-serialize command), it will skip any blobs that have already been serialized in previous images to avoid duplicate work.
